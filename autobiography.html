                    <h3>Roots in Two Worlds</h3>
                    <p>I was born in Naperville, Illinois, to immigrant parents with unique and diverse backgrounds. My mom, a Lithuanian, came to the U.S. in her early twenties with her best friend, chasing new opportunities. My dad, a first-generation Belarusian with Polish roots, arrived in his mid-twenties. Despite a nine-year age gap, they met at a restaurant in Chicago, fell in love, got married, and eventually—I came along.</p>
                    <p>My childhood was full of love, and I spent most of my time with my grandmother. But everything changed when I was five. In early May, we packed up and moved to Belarus for my dad’s business. Since he was originally from there, he knew it was the right move for our family. We settled in Grodno, a city near the Polish and Lithuanian borders, where I was thrown into a completely different culture and way of life.</p>

                    <h3>Early Education in Belarus</h3>
                    <p>Belarus was a fascinating place, rich in culture and history. Russian was the dominant language in most regions, while Belarusian was more commonly spoken in the southern areas near Ukraine. The country had a unique blend of Soviet influences and modern European elements, making it an interesting place to grow up. My father was well-known in Grodno due to his work in border control, and his connections helped me gain admission to one of the city’s most prestigious schools: Grodno City Gymnasium. This school was highly competitive, attracting the best students in the area, and being accepted was a significant achievement.</p>
                    <p>The education system in Belarus was quite different from what I would later experience in the U.S. Elementary school lasted just one year (first grade), middle school covered second through fourth grade, and high school started in fifth grade, continuing all the way to eleventh. The academic year was divided into four quarters, with short breaks in between. Instead of the letter grading system used in the U.S., Belarusian schools used a 10-point scale—10 being 100%, 9 for 90%, and so on. The expectations were high, and students were required to maintain strong performance across all subjects.</p>
                    <p>To continue at Grodno City Gymnasium, students had to pass a rigorous entrance exam after fourth grade, scoring at least 26/30 across three core subjects: math, Russian, and Belarusian. Math and Russian came naturally to me, but Belarusian was a struggle—I had never spoken it at home, and barely knew anyone who did. To help me prepare, my parents found a retired Belarusian language teacher who tutored me twice a week, starting from the basics. It wasn’t easy, but with time, I gained confidence in the language.</p>
                    <p>Her lessons paid off. When exam day arrived in May 2014, I aced my math test with a perfect 10/10, scored 9/10 in Russian, and—against all odds—earned another 10/10 in Belarusian. My total score of 29/30 was more than enough to secure my place at the school. The relief and pride I felt were indescribable. After months of hard work, I had proven to myself that determination and effort could overcome any obstacle.</p>

                    <h3>High School Years in Belarus</h3>
                    <p>Starting high school (fifth grade in Belarus), I had to figure out where to focus my time outside of regular classes. Math had always been my favorite subject, so joining the Math Team was a natural choice. At first, we competed against other schools in Grodno, but as we improved, we went up against the top teams from Belarus’s six major cities: Minsk, Gomel, Vitebsk, Grodno, Brest, and Mogilev. The competitions were intense, often requiring creative problem-solving and quick thinking under pressure. I loved the challenge and the camaraderie of working with my teammates, pushing each other to do better with every contest.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, basketball remained a huge part of my life. My best friend Georgy and I had been recruited to a local team back in third grade, and we quickly developed a deep love for the game. When I switched to my school’s team, the competition became even more serious. We trained rigorously, often having practice sessions before and after school. Our hard work paid off—we didn’t just play against local teams but got the chance to compete internationally in Poland and Lithuania. Playing against foreign teams exposed us to different playstyles and strategies, making every game an exciting learning experience. The travel was also eye-opening, giving me a glimpse of life outside Belarus and a deeper appreciation for different cultures.</p>
                    <p>School in Belarus was no joke. Unlike American schools, where students follow the same seven-period schedule each day, we had a rotating schedule with 12-14 subjects spread throughout the week. Math, Russian, and Belarusian were part of our daily routine, but other subjects like history, biology, physics, and literature were scheduled only a few times a week. Some days were packed with challenging subjects, while others felt slightly lighter, but there was never a moment to slack off. The workload was demanding, requiring constant studying and preparation, but I thrived in the structured environment. The intensity of academics, combined with extracurricular activities, taught me discipline and time management—skills that would later become invaluable in my life.</p>

                    <h3>A Sudden Move Back to the U.S.</h3>
                    <p>In January 2018, my parents dropped unexpected news—we were moving back to the U.S. in May. I was in eighth grade, focused on upcoming exams that would shape my high school path, so the thought of leaving everything behind like friends, school, and the life I had built felt unreal. My parents didn’t give many details, just that it was the best decision for our future. Looking back, I realize their timing was perfect. Belarus soon became politically unstable under President Aleksandr Lukashenko, who had been in power for over 30 years since the Soviet Union’s collapse.</p>
                    <p>When we arrived in the U.S. in May 2018, it felt like stepping into a completely different world. I barely spoke English and struggled to understand anything around me. We settled in Lisle, Illinois, where I started at Lisle High School—a small school with only about 400 students, which made it easier to adjust. I joined the ESL (English as a Second Language) program, where my teacher’s patience and structured lessons helped me navigate not just the language but also American culture. Over time, I made great friends and slowly started to feel at home, but it wasn’t until junior year that I truly felt confident speaking English.</p>

                    <h3>Finding Computer Science</h3>
                    <p>One of the most influential people in my life was my engineering professor, Mr. Bamboat. He introduced me to Python in his computer science class and sparked my interest in engineering through hands-on projects. Beyond the classroom, we built a strong mentor-student relationship, often discussing my future and potential career paths. At the time, I enjoyed programming but wasn’t entirely sure if it was the right major for me.</p>
                    <p>During one of our conversations, he said that I had taken his Python class entirely online during COVID. Despite the isolation, I found it both engaging and challenging in the best way. He said this was proof of my passion for computer science—if I enjoyed coding even under those conditions, it was something worth pursuing seriously.</p>
                    <p>After many discussions, we determined that Iowa State University was the best choice for me. It had a strong computer science program, plenty of opportunities to grow, and, most importantly, it was affordable. With his guidance and encouragement, I took the leap, confident that I was on the right path.</p>

                    <h3>Discovering a New Passion: The Gym</h3>
                    <p>One of the best friends I’ve ever met introduced me to the gym the summer before my senior year of high school. At first, it was just something fun to do together, but over time, it became much more than that. Lifting weights wasn’t just about getting stronger—it was about discipline, consistency, and pushing myself past my limits. Every session felt like progress, not just physically, but mentally.</p>
                    <p>No matter what was going on in my life, the gym became my escape, a place where I could clear my mind and focus on improving myself. That mindset carried over into other areas of my life, teaching me the value of hard work and persistence, whether it was in academics, personal projects, or anything else I set my mind to.</p>

                    <h3>Finding My Path</h3>
                    <p>When I started my freshman year at Iowa State, I had no idea what to expect. I had chosen computer science, but my intro courses didn’t spark the excitement I had hoped for. They felt dry, and I started doubting my decision. I lost motivation, and combined with some personal challenges, my first year didn’t turn out as well as I had imagined. I thought college would be this exciting, eye-opening journey, but instead, I felt stuck, unsure if I had made the right choice.</p>
                    <p>Everything changed in my second year when I took COMS 228 (Introduction to Data Structures) and COMS 230 (Discrete Mathematics). That’s when I got hooked. I had never thought about coding beyond just writing scripts to solve problems, but these courses introduced me to the deeper theoretical aspects of computing. It was like a switch flipped in my head. Suddenly, I wasn’t just doing assignments—I was genuinely interested. I started understanding how algorithms worked, why data structures mattered, and how everything fit together. This was the moment I realized that I wanted to stick with computer science. I still didn’t know exactly which area to choose. Either AI engineering, backend development or full-stack development.</p>

                    <h3>Gaining Experience and Getting Hooked</h3>
                    <p>My internship at the DePaul DICE Lab introduced me to large-scale software systems, automation, and optimization. I designed a Docker container interface on an Ubuntu VM, integrating Content-Defined Merkle Trees (CDMT) to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency. Additionally, I built a data processing pipeline using Python and NumPy to enhance log analytics and anomaly detection. One of the biggest takeaways from this experience was learning how to automate workflows, improving deployment and resource management. Working in an environment focused on optimizing software performance helped me develop a deeper appreciation for systems engineering beyond just writing code.</p>
                    <p>Alongside my internship, I developed Cherzy Crypto Bot, a Python-based Telegram bot that delivered real-time cryptocurrency updates. I’ve always loved Telegram, so combining it with automation and APIs made this project especially exciting. It was my first time deploying something that interacted with live data and served real users, reinforcing my passion for building practical software.</p>
                    <p>As soon as the new semester started, I joined the Software Analytics and Pervasive Parallelism Lab (SwAPP) as a researcher, where I built dataset processing tools using Tree-sitter, NumPy, and APIs to automate labeling, improving efficiency by 60%. While the research was engaging, I quickly realized I was more drawn to building systems than analyzing models. This experience solidified my focus on software development, confirming that I thrive in designing and optimizing solutions rather than purely theoretical work.</p>

                    <h3>Rock Climbing</h3>
                    <p>During the fall of 2024, I discovered another passion—rock climbing. What started as a casual outing with friends quickly turned into something I genuinely loved. Climbing was more than just a physical challenge; it was a puzzle that required strategy, problem-solving, and mental endurance. Every route was different, forcing me to think, adapt, and push my limits. I loved the feeling of progress, the small victories of reaching a new hold or completing a climb that seemed impossible just days before.</p>
                    <p>But what made it even better was the community. Climbing with my friends, encouraging each other, and celebrating our successes together made it one of the most rewarding experiences. It became something I looked forward to every week, a way to challenge myself both physically and mentally while sharing that journey with people who pushed me to be better.</p>
